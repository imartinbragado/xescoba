learned C++ by myself from a book.  C++ has evolved a lot in those years, and
so have I in my coding style. I will try to update the code little by little
if I have time to avoid some implementation problems I have seen, but the code
compiles and works.

1.- What is xescoba?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	xescoba is an 'escoba' (broom, sweeping) playing program. The escoba 
game is a popular Spanish cards game.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1- What are 'escoba' rules?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The 'escoba' purpose is to win the greatest possible amount of cards,
golds, sevens, sweepings and the special card named the 'velo', that is, the
seven of golds. Every sweeping and the 'velo' wins one point. For the rest
the point is won when you have more amount of golds, cards or sevens than
the others.

	You make a 'escoba' or a sweeping when you win all the cards on the
center.

	Playing 'escoba' is simple: You have only to play a card every turn.
If there is some combination of this card with centers ones adding 15 you
win this cards. If not your card stays on center. In order to make this
combination you should know that knights are 9 points, kings 10 and 'sotas'
8 points. That is. The cards whose nominal value are 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 are
evaluated as 1,2,3,4,5,6 and 7 (no difficult!) and the 10,11 and 12 as 8,9
and 10. Here is a table:

	Nominal value.		Real value for adding
	1				1
	2				2
	3				3
	4				4
	5				5
	6				6
	7				7
	10 (sota)			8
	11 (knight)			9
	12 (king) 			10

	For example: Playing a seven with a 'sota' is a valid trick, because
they add 15. 
	More examples: Here are some examples. NOTE: There are a lot of
more valid tricks then the ones here!.
	Real cards			Values for adding  

	1,4,king			1+4+10 = 15  	OK!
	2,2,2,knight			2+2+2+9=15	OK!
	7+sota				7+8=15		OK!
	4,5,6				4+5+6=15	OK!
	1,1,3,7,3			1+1+3+7+3=15	OK! 	
	
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.- What are xescoba options?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1.- In menu
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	In the properties option of menu you can chose:

	Sound	
		Make sound active or not.
	Game exposition window
		To active or not the visualization of last trick.
	Advice	
		When advice is active the computer select for you what it
		think is the better trick. If you accept it only have to
		click in turn button. Else you should reselect your trick
		and clicking turn button.
	Configuration
		When selecting configuration you obtain a configuration
		dialog. Here you can select the number of players (from 2 to
		4) and their nature (human or computer ones). You can write
		their names, too.
		This dialog modifies the configuration file. (Further
		information in 2.2) 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2.- The configuration file.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

	The configuration file .xescoba should be in $HOME. Such file have
the following fields:

	jugadores = players_number

		players_number is a number from 1 to 4

	jugador0 = player_name0
	jugador1 = player_name1
	jugador2 = player_name2
	jugador3 = player_name3
	naturaleza0 = 0_or_1
	naturaleza1 = 0_or_1
	naturaleza2 = 0_or_1
	naturaleza3 = 0_or_1

	For a human player you write:
		naturalezaX = 0
	where 'X' is a 0,1,2,3 according with the other fields. For a
	computer one you write 
		naturalezaX = 1

	linux kernel)

logo.txt:

	 This is the full-colour version of the currently unofficial Linux logo

	that I haven't really announced it yet).  It was created by Larry Ewing,
	and is freely usable as long as you acknowledge Larry as the original
	artist.

	Note that there are black-and-white versions of this available that
	scale down to smaller sizes and are better for letterheads or whatever
	you want to use it for: for the full range of logos take a look at
	Larry's web-page:
