1.2.1	1.2.0 didn't compile propertly under recent gcc version. The bug was
	in the itemfactory.c, used to put the menus. Now the menus was
	complety rewriting from scratch, helped by glade. Other minor
	changes.
1.2.0	Update program to compile under GTK+ 1.2.0. This includes: better
	menus, the "Game exposition Window" now has a colourized text
	widget, more documentation (I've created a man page and translate
	documentation into English). Improving the external aspect of the
	program. (Using xescobarc).
